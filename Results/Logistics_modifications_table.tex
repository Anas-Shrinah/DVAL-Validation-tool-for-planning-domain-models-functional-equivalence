\hline 
\textbf{Domain version}  & \textbf{Expected impact} & \textbf{Modification description}     \\ \hline  
Logistics with crafted valid macro & Yes & The valid macro operator ``load-fly-unload-airplane'' is handcrafted and added to this modified version.
 \\  \hline
Logistics with random valid macro & Yes & The valid macro operator ``load-truck-location-load-truck-airport-load-airplane'' is randomly created from the operators of the original domain and added to this modified version.
 \\  \hline
Logistics with random invalid macro & No & The invalid macro operator ``load-truck-location-load-truck-airport-load-airplane'' is added to this modified version. This invalid macro is produced from the valid macro that is explained in the previous entry of this table by swapping the add effect (in-truck ?x1 ?x4) with the precondition (at-package-location ?x1 ?x2) in the original valid macro.
 \\  \hline
Logistics with swapped atoms & No & The atom (at-truck-location ?truck ?loc-to) in the add effects of the operator ``drive-truck-airport-location'' in the original domain is changed to a precondition in this modified version, and the atom (airport-in-city ?loc-from ?city) from the preconditions of the same operator in the original domain is changed to an add effect in this modified version.
 \\  \hline
Logistics with deleted operator & No & The operator ``fly-airplane'' is removed from this modified domain, this operator exists in the original domain.

\caption{The description of the modifications applied to the Logistics domain to produce its modified versions. Expected impact: ``yes'' means the introduced modification to the original Logistics domain is expected to produce a version that is functionally equivalent to the original domain. }
