\hline 
\textbf{Domain version}  & \textbf{Expected impact} & \textbf{Modification description}     \\ \hline  
Gripper with crafted valid macro & Yes & The valid macro operator ``pick-move-drop'' is handcrafted and added to this modified version.
 \\  \hline
Gripper with random valid macro & Yes & The valid macro operator ``move-pick-drop'' is randomly created from the operators of the original domain and added to this modified version.
 \\  \hline
Gripper with random invalid macro & No & The invalid macro operator ``move-pick-drop'' is added to this modified version. This invalid macro is produced from the valid macro that is explained in the previous entry of this table by swapping the add effect (at-robby ?x2) with the precondition (at ?x3 ?x2) in the original valid macro.
 \\  \hline
Gripper with swapped atoms & No & The atom (at-robby ?to) in the add effects of the operator ``move'' in the original domain is changed to a precondition in this modified version, and the atom (at-robby ?from) from the preconditions of the same operator in the original domain is changed to an add effect in this modified version.
 \\  \hline
Gripper with deleted operator & No & The operator ``drop'' is removed from this modified domain, this operator exists in the original domain.
 \\  \hline

\caption{The description of the modifications applied to the Gripper domain to produce its modified versions. Expected impact: ``yes'' means the introduced modification to the original Gripper domain is expected to produce a version that is functionally equivalent to the original domain. }
